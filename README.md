Hey! **I’m Jer (also known as AySail),** a young hobbyist coder with a **passion** for creating cool stuff. This repo is home to my ongoing projects, experiments, and creative ventures.

About Me

🌱 **Coding as a hobby** — always learning and trying new things

🎨 **Into creative arts** — I love combining creativity with tech

🌍 **Big fan of geopolitics and geography** — always curious about the world

💻 Mainly code on **macOS,** using **VS Code** and sometimes **TurboWarp**

🎮 Working on **Jer’s Playground** — a website filled with micro and mini games I’m building

🎨 Use **Inkscape** and **Figma** for **vector graphics and design**

🚀 Excited about upcoming cool games and projects!

**💻My Setup**

At the moment, I’m coding and creating on a **MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017)** running **macOS Monterey 12.7.6**. Some of the main apps and tools I use include **VS Cod**e for coding, **TurboWarp** for Scratch-based projects, **Figma and Inkscape** for design and vector graphics, **Zen Browser** for browsing, **Notion** for organizing my ideas, Prism Launcher for managing Minecraft mods, plus the built-in macOS Calculator and Terminal for everyday tasks. I also use **AlDente** to manage my MacBook’s battery health. This setup helps me balance coding, creative work, and productivity smoothly.

And don’t stress—you’ve done great today. Take a moment to relax and reflect on how your day’s been. Sending love to everyone who enjoys my projects—they’re made for you. 💙

Thanks for stopping by! Stay creative and keep exploring. 🚀

— Jer (AySail)
